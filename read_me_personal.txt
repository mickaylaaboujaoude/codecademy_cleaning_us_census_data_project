I started by working through the steps in the Codecademy "Cleaning US Census Data" project, but then I expanded beyond the project tasks and the order in which the tasks were listed, using it as opportuntiy to learn additional useful functions (that weren't taught by Codecademy) and practice my skills

Update 9/9/21 5:48pm: 
I successfully cleaned the data.
I will return to project later to make the histograms. They asked us to make them before providing us the lesson with how…which is weird because there is a lesson later… anyways I'd prefer to finish going through the course material and then return to this later.


Update 9/9/21 8:46pm:
Make sure you are using the words "variable" and "value" correctly through out your project. 
Defining tidy data
The structure Wickham defines as tidy has the following attributes:
	• Each variable forms a column and contains values
	• Each observation forms a row
	• Each type of observational unit forms a table
A few definitions:
	• Variable: A measurement or an attribute. Height, weight, sex, etc.
	• Value: The actual measurement or attribute. 152 cm, 80 kg, female, etc.
	• Observation: All values measure on the same unit. Each person.
