#Codecademy Cleaning US Census Data Project

##Introduction
Initially, I started by working through the steps in the Codecademy "Cleaning US Census Data" project, but then I expanded beyond the project tasks and the order in which the tasks were listed, using it as opportuntiy to learn additional useful function and practice my skills. 

I then rearranged the order of the steps of cleaning the data from the original Codecademy project order to an order I thought made more sense to show how I would approach cleaning the data set.
